                    <p>Bamboo Ply</p>
                    <div>Durable in higher moisture content.</div>
                    <div>Takes little time to grow in comparision. 4 to 6 years. New shoots sprout right after cultivation. It's a type of grass. It holds record for fastes growing flora.</div>
                    <div>12% Harder than American maple, 25% harder than red oak. Where it shines is it's tensile strength which is <b>comparable to steel</b>(400MPa of structural steel, 200Mpa of Bamboo).  You must have seen several story high architectural scaffolding made of bamboo.</div>
                    <div>Multi-layered, cross-laminated and heat-pressed can be 3 times more durable than traditional hardwood. Janka test (not scientific, but industry standard in woodwork industry) places it at between 3000 to 4000, depending upon quality of build.</div>
                    <div>No formaldehyde or any other harmful chemical is used during manufaturing ply. Due to high growth rate it sinks Carbon dioxide, it's carbon negative.</div>

                    <div>Not durable in higher moisture content.</div>
                    <div>Takes long time to grow, entire groves are destroyed for cultivation. It can take decades or even centuries to grow.</div>

                <p>Points in favor</p>
                <div>Europeans/Americans (uses most wood in houses) find it a costly option, since it is mostly imported from Asia. It grows here natively.</div>
                <div>1927 Act classified it as tree, so harvest and transportation was not an option, it was illegal. 2017 Act deems it as a grass, so it can be transported and cultivated commercially.</div>
